    To run this program in VSCode, run from App.java with VsCode java extensions installed. Type in the 
    player ID/codenames, then run the traffic genarator from python_trafficgenarator.py during the 30
    second countdown. Type in the required information into the terminal then click back into the 
    play action window.

App.java : This is the class with our Main function - where we make database connection and display logo
playerEntry.java : This is where players enter their ID/codename into a table by JTable.
playActionDisplay.java : This is where play action is displayed.
timerTest.java : This contains the countdown timer that displays a countdown in a new window before the
    start of the game.
python_trafficgenarator.py : This generates the game actions instantly to simulate real game play.
