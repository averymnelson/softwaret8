    *THIS CODE DOES NOT CURRENTLY RUN DUE TO DISCONNECTED HEROKU DATABASE*
    To run this program in VSCode, run from App.java with VsCode java extensions installed. Type in the player ID/codenames to the player entry screen. Then run the traffic genarator from python_trafficgenarator.py during the 30 second countdown. You can do this by pressing the triangle play button while in that file. Type the required information into the python terminal, then click back into the play action window.

App.java : This is the class with our Main function - where we make socket connections to recieve traffic and display the logo
playerEntry.java : This is where players enter their ID/codename into a table by JTable, and where we make the database connections to insert the players. If there is a valid codename in the databse, typing the ID will auto populate it. 
playActionDisplay.java : This is where play action is displayed with the winning player and team indicated by *. The most recent game activity is at the bottom of the game log, with scrollability to see every event above.
timerTest.java : This contains the countdown timer that displays a countdown in a new window before the start of the game.
python_trafficgenarator.py : This generates the game actions instantly to simulate real game play.
